3rd party script:
use Google Analytic 3rd party js with gtag to check how many visitors which just put the gtag into the html and put the netlify website into the google analytic. I can base on those to do some improve of my website and can clearly find that what change gains more visitor or what change loss visitors. It will also help me to discover new users and can analytic the user's activities and how long they spend time on my website. Though those analytic, it will show a lot of useful information for us, and can help to improve the site with more ideas.
